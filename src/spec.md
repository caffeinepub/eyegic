# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the “Admin” control/button from the site header on both desktop and mobile while leaving the rest of the header unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the “Admin” button/control from the desktop header UI.
- Remove the “Admin” button/control from the mobile sheet/menu UI.
- Keep all other header content and behaviors unchanged (navigation links, Contact Us dropdown, My Bookings, My Profile, Login/Logout).

**User-visible outcome:** Users (including admins) no longer see an “Admin” button/control in the header on desktop or in the mobile menu, while all other header actions work as before.
