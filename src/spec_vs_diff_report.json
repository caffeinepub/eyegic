  "summary": "Header and footer branding were updated to use a text-only \"EYEGIC\" Link via the new/updated BrandLogo component and footer markup. However, the diff evidence still shows an existing logo hook and related logo utilities/pages referenced in summaries, which conflicts with the requirement to remove all logo images and eliminate logo-hook references if unused. Mobile-menu/header sizing behavior is only partially evidenced.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Remove all instances of the current logo image across the entire app so no UI renders the logo image anywhere (including ensuring no <img> uses src \"/assets/generated/EYEGIC LOGO powered by lensdirect.dim_1536x1024.png\"), and the app builds with no unused-import/typecheck errors.",
      "reason": "The diff evidence does not demonstrate removal of all logo image usages across the app. Additionally, the presence of a dedicated logo hook (and the summaries referencing logo utilities/pages) suggests image-based logo handling may still exist, which risks leaving <img> usages and/or unused imports behind.",

      "reason": "Desktop header appears to use a clamp-based large text variant, but the provided summary indicates the mobile menu uses the default fixed sizing rather than the same max-fit-to-header approach. Also, the diff does not show SiteHeader.tsx code to confirm the mobile-sheet brand uses the onClick close behavior (BrandLogo supports it, but usage is not evidenced here).",
