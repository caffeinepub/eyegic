Additionally, a documentation/summary file claims many unrelated UI/animation changes that are not requested (and not evidenced as actual code changes in the modified file list).",

      "reason": "No new asset file was added in the diff (Added files: none), and BrandLogo references a different filename/path (\"...dim_1536x864.png\" under /assets/generated) rather than the required exact file name \"EYEGIC LOGO for ID cards-2.png\". Also, there is no code evidence in the modified files list showing header/mobile sheet logo usage being updated beyond BrandLogo itself.",
