  "summary": "The diff adds a home-route detection hook and updates the SiteHeader to conditionally include My Profile and Admin Notifications controls. However, due to truncation, key acceptance criteria (exact Version 32 behavior, navigation targets, and mobile/non-home route behavior) cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Clicking “My Profile” navigates to /profile and the control is visible/clickable when authenticated (matching Version 32).",
      "reason": "The SiteHeader diff is truncated at the point where the authenticated controls and click handlers would appear, so the /profile navigation and exact behavior/appearance cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence.",

      "requirement": "Clicking “Notifications” navigates to /admin/notifications and the control is visible/clickable for admin users (matching Version 32).",
      "reason": "While AdminNotificationsControl is imported, the truncated diff does not show it being rendered nor any navigation wiring to /admin/notifications.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure the restored controls do not appear on non-home routes for both desktop header and the mobile navigation experience (no alternate entry in header or menu on non-home routes).",
      "reason": "A home-route hook is added, but the truncated header diff does not show how the mobile menu/sheet contents are conditionally rendered by route, so the mobile-nav portion of the requirement cannot be verified.",
