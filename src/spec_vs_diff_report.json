  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented by refactoring TanStack Router setup to use a RootLayout root route (avoiding referencing an uninitialized router). REQ-3 appears implemented by adding a buildInfo config and displaying the identifier in the footer. REQ-2 cannot be fully verified from the provided diff summary because frontend/src/main.tsx is not shown, so we cannot confirm there is exactly one QueryClientProvider at runtime. Several unrelated UI/feature changes appear in the diff summary that were not requested.",
