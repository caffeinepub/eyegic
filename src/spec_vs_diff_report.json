      "reason": "No new static asset file is added (Added files: none), and the code references a different filename (the \".dim_1536x1024.png\" variant) instead of the exact required \"EYEGIC LOGO for ID cards-5.png\".",

      "reason": "The repo still includes/mentions frontend utilities and hooks for fetching/uploading logos from the backend and a settings page for uploading/replacing a logo, which contradicts the requirement to avoid logo-management UI and backend logo calls and to have no other logo logic.",
